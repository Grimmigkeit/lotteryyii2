# lotteryyii2

My first project on yii2.

Get random prize for authorised user. Money, points or item. User can refuse prize and convert money to points.

For create admin user go to "/index.php?r=site/add-admin"
login/password - "admin"

"/index.php?r=site/lottery" - page for lottery.

Console comand for send money - "php yii cron 222" where 222 - amount of money.
